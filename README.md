# (a)                Volcano Plot for Proteomics Data

This repository contains code to create a volcano plot from proteomics data. The plot compares Sample A vs. Sample B to show the differential expression of proteins between the two conditions.

Guide for protein fold change and p-value calculation for non-experts in proteomics, 

Overview
	â€¢	What It Does:
Generates a volcano plot. One quadrant shows proteins that are up-regulated, and another shows proteins that are down-regulated between the two conditions.
	â€¢	Background:
 
In proteomics, volcano plots help visualize changes in protein expression.
	â€¢	X-axis: Log2 fold change (difference between conditions)
	â€¢	Y-axis: -log10(p-value) (statistical significance)
 
This plot type is common in differential expression analysis.

	â€¢	Provided Data:
 
A dummy Excel file is included to run the notebook and test the code. 
(2_sampleA_sampleB.xlsx)

How to Use
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/saadnaseem/plots.git

	2.	Open the Notebook:
Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

	3.	Run the Code:
Load the dummy Excel file and execute the notebook to see the volcano plot.

Who Should Care
	â€¢	Biologists & Bioinformaticians:
Easily visualize differential protein expression.
	â€¢	Metabolic Engineers & Genomics Researchers:
Quickly assess changes in protein levels between conditions.

Requirements
	â€¢	Python 3.x
	â€¢	Required libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly, etc.




#  (b) Growth Curves Plotting Script

This repository contains the `growthcurves_github` script to generate **growth curves** from experimental data. The **x-axis** represents **time**, and the **y-axis** represents **absorbance** (OD600). 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In biological experiments, measurements are often taken in **triplicates** to ensure accuracy. This script:
- **Averages** the triplicate values.
- **Calculates the standard deviation** to show variability.
- **Plots the growth curves** with error bars.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository
- **`growthcurves_github.py`** â€“ Python script to process and visualize growth curves.
- **`data_growthcurve.xlsx`** â€“ Dummy data file for testing the script.

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl

ðŸš€ How to Use
	1.	Prepare Your Data
	â€¢	Your data should be in an Excel file (.xlsx format).
	â€¢	The first column should be time.
	â€¢	The next columns should be absorbance values for different wells.
	2.	Run the Script

python growthcurves_github.py


	3.	Output
	â€¢	A growth curve plot with error bars will be generated.
	â€¢	The x-axis represents time (hours).
	â€¢	The y-axis represents absorbance (OD600).

ðŸ“Š Example Data Format (data_growthcurve.xlsx)

Time (hrs)	A1	A2	A3	B1	B2	B3	â€¦
0.0	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.1	â€¦
1.0	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.2	â€¦
2.0	0.3	0.3	0.3	0.3	0.3	0.3	â€¦
